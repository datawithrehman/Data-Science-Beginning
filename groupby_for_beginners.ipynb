    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In data analysis, you often need to summarize data by categories. For example, you might want to find the average sales for each product category, or the total quantity sold per region. The `groupby()` function in pandas is an incredibly powerful tool that allows you to do just that. It’s similar to the “PivotTable” feature in Excel, but with much more flexibility and power in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, `groupby()` involves three steps: \n",
    "1.  **Splitting** the data into groups based on some criteria.\n",
    "2.  **Applying** a function (like `mean()`, `sum()`, `count()`, etc.) to each group independently.\n",
    "3.  **Combining** the results into a single data structure.\n",
    "\n",
